# LeetCode Topic Analyzer (Beta)

A Chrome extension that intelligently analyzes LeetCode problems and highlights keywords that reveal the underlying algorithm or data structure being tested. This tool helps you quickly identify problem-solving patterns and improve your algorithmic thinking.

Currently building a ML model to analyze problem descriptions and highlight keywords that help identify the topic of the problem instead of having a hardcoded dictionary (current implementation).

## Features

### Smart Keyword Detection
- Automatically identifies and highlights topic-related keywords in problem descriptions
- Color-coded highlighting for 12 major algorithm/data structure topics
- Real-time analysis as you navigate between problems

### Topic Classification
The extension recognizes and highlights keywords for these topics:

- **Arrays & Strings** - array, string, substring, subarray, concatenate, split, join
- **Linked Lists** - linked list, node, next, head, tail, pointer, traverse
- **Trees & Graphs** - tree, graph, node, edge, vertex, root, leaf, traversal
- **Dynamic Programming** - dp, dynamic programming, memoization, recursion, optimal
- **Two Pointers** - two pointers, slow, fast, pointer, collision, meeting
- **Sliding Window** - sliding window, window, k elements, consecutive
- **Binary Search** - binary search, sorted, middle, left, right, target
- **Stack & Queue** - stack, queue, push, pop, peek, dequeue, enqueue
- **Hash Table** - hash, hashmap, hashset, dictionary, key, value, lookup
- **Greedy** - greedy, optimal, local optimum, choice, select
- **Backtracking** - backtrack, combination, permutation, subset, recursion
- **Bit Manipulation** - bit, xor, and, or, shift, mask, binary

### Customizable Experience
- Toggle analysis on/off with a single click
- Enable/disable specific topics individually
- Adjust highlight opacity for better readability
- Auto-analyze on page load option
- Persistent settings across browser sessions

## Installation

### Method 1: Load Unpacked Extension (Development)

1. **Clone or download this repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd lc-helper
   ```

2. **Open Chrome Extensions Page**
   - Navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
   - Enable "Developer mode" in the top right corner

3. **Load the Extension**
   - Click "Load unpacked"
   - Select the folder containing the extension files
   - The extension should now appear in your extensions list

4. **Pin the Extension**
   - Click the puzzle piece icon in Chrome's toolbar
   - Find "LeetCode Topic Analyzer" and click the pin icon

### Method 2: Chrome Web Store (Coming Soon)
- The extension will be available on the Chrome Web Store for easy installation

## Usage

### Basic Usage
1. **Navigate to LeetCode**
   - Go to any LeetCode problem page (e.g., https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)
   - The extension will automatically analyze the problem description

2. **View Highlights**
   - Keywords will be highlighted with color-coded backgrounds
   - Hover over highlights to see topic information
   - Click the extension icon to open the control panel

### Advanced Features

#### Popup Controls
- **Enable/Disable Analysis**: Toggle keyword highlighting on/off
- **Topic Legend**: View all supported topics with their colors
- **Topic Toggle**: Click on topics to enable/disable specific categories
- **Settings**: Adjust opacity and auto-analyze preferences
- **Statistics**: See how many topics and keywords were found

#### Keyboard Shortcuts
- `Ctrl+Shift+A` (or `Cmd+Shift+A` on Mac): Toggle analysis
- `Ctrl+Shift+R` (or `Cmd+Shift+R` on Mac): Refresh analysis
- `Ctrl+Shift+C` (or `Cmd+Shift+C` on Mac): Clear highlights

#### Context Menu
- Right-click on any LeetCode page to access quick actions
- "Analyze LeetCode Problem" - Refresh the analysis
- "Clear Highlights" - Remove all highlights


## Troubleshooting

### Extension Not Working
1. **Check if you're on LeetCode**: The extension only works on leetcode.com
2. **Refresh the page**: Try refreshing the LeetCode problem page
3. **Check console**: Open Developer Tools (F12) and check for errors
4. **Reinstall extension**: Remove and reload the extension

### Highlights Not Appearing
1. **Enable analysis**: Make sure the toggle is enabled in the popup
2. **Check topic settings**: Ensure the relevant topics are enabled
3. **Page structure**: Some LeetCode pages might use different selectors

### Performance Issues
1. **Disable unused topics**: Turn off topics you don't need
2. **Reduce opacity**: Lower the highlight opacity setting
3. **Clear highlights**: Use the clear button to remove existing highlights
